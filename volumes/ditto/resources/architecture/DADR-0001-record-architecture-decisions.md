# Record architecture decisions

Date: 14.08.2019

## Status

accepted

## Context

We want to record architectural decisions made on the Ditto project to keep track of the motivation behind certain decisions.

## Decision

We will use Architecture Decision Records, as described by Michael Nygard in this 
[article](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions) and also use the proposed
 [template](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/architecture_decision_record/blob/master/adr_template_by_michael_nygard.md).

## Consequences

From Michael Nygard's article (link above): 
> The motivation behind previous decisions is visible for everyone, present and future. Nobody is left scratching
> their heads to understand, "What were they thinking?" and the time to change old decisions will be clear from changes 
> in the project's context.
