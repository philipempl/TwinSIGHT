  JSON object of all attributes to be modified at once. Consider that the
  value has to be a JSON object or `null`.

  Examples:
   * an empty object: `{}` - would just delete all old attributes
   * a simple object: `{ "key": "value"}` - We strongly recommend to use a restricted set of characters for the key (identifier), as the key might be needed for the (URL) path later.<br> Currently these identifiers should follow the pattern: [_a-zA-Z][_a-zA-Z0-9\-]*
   * a nested object as shown in the example value
required: true
