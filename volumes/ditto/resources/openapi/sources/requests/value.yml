  JSON representation of the value to be created/updated. This may be as
  well `null` or an empty object.

  Consider that the value has to be a JSON value, examples:

    * for a number, the JSON value is the number: `42`

    * for a string, the JSON value must be quoted: `"aString"`

    * for a boolean, the JSON value is the boolean: `true`

    * for an object, the JSON value is the object: `{ "key": "value"}` -} We strongly recommend to use a restricted set of characters for the key (identifier). Currently these identifiers should follow the pattern: [_a-zA-Z][_a-zA-Z0-9\-]*

    * for an list, the JSON value is the list: `[ 1,2,3 ]`
