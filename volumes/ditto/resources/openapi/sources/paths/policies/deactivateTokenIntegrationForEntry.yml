  summary: Deactivate a subject for this policy entry derived from the token
  description: |-
    **This action only works when authenticated with a Json Web Token (JWT).**

    Based on the authenticated token (JWT), **this policy entry** is checked to match those conditions:
    * the authenticated token is granted the `EXECUTE` permission to perform the `deactivateTokenIntegration` action
    * one of the subject IDs is contained in the authenticated token

    When all conditions match, the calculated subject with information extracted from the authenticated JWT is **removed
    from this policy entry**.

    The injected subjects expire when the JWT expires. The `expiry` timestamp (a string in ISO-8601 format)
    specifies how long the specific subject will have access to the resource secured by the policy.
    The subject will be automatically deleted from the policy once this timestamp is reached.
    To give the subject a chance to prolong the access he can configure a connection to get announcements.
    Policy announcements are published to websockets and connections that have the relevant subject ID.

    The settings under `announcement` control when a policy announcement is published (before expiry or when deleted).
    If the field `requestedAcks` is set, then the announcements are published with at-least-once delivery until
    the acknowledgement requests under labels are fulfilled.
    If a "beforeExpiry" announcement was sent without acknowledgement requests, or the a "beforeExpiry"
    announcement was acknowledged, the "whenDeleted" announcement will not be triggered.
