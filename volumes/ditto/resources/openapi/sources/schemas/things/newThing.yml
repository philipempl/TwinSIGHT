      - $ref: "../policies/policy.yml"
    description: |-
      The initial policy to create for this thing. This will create a separate policy entity managed by resource `/policies/{thingId}`.


      Use the placeholder `{{ request:subjectId }}` in order to let the backend insert the authenticated subjectId of the HTTP request.
  _copyPolicyFrom:
    type: string
    description: |-
      This field may contain
      * the policy ID of an existing policy.

        The policy is copied and used for this newly created thing. The
        caller needs to have READ and WRITE<sup>*</sup> access to the policy.
      * a placeholder reference to a thing in the format {{ ref:things/[thingId]/policyId }} where you need to
        replace [thingId] with a valid thing ID.

        The newly created thing will then obtain a copy of the policy of
        the referenced thing. The caller needs to have READ access to the thing and READ and WRITE<sup>*</sup>
        access to the policy of the thing.


      <sup>*</sup> The check for WRITE permission avoids locking yourself out of the newly created policy. You can
      bypass this check by setting the header `allowPolicyLockout` to `true`. Be aware that the authorized
      subject cannot modify the policy if you do not assign WRITE permission on the policy resource!

      If you want to specify a policy ID for the copied policy, use the policyId field.

      This field must not be used together with the field _policy. If you specify both _policy and _copyPolicyFrom
      this will lead to an error response.
  policyId:
    type: string

      The policy ID used for controlling access to this thing. Managed by
      resource `/policies/{policyId}`.
