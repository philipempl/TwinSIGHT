  Contains a comma-separated list of fields from one or more features to be
  included in the returned JSON.

  #### Selectable fields

  * `{featureId}` The ID of the feature to select properties in
    * `properties`
      Supports selecting arbitrary sub-fields by using a comma-separated list:
        * several properties paths can be passed as a comma-separated list of JSON pointers (RFC-6901)
          For example:
            * `?fields={featureId}/properties/color` would select only `color` property value (if present) of the feature identified with `{featureId}`
            * `?fields={featureId}/properties/color,properties/brightness` would select only `color` and `brightness` property values (if present) of the feature identified with `{featureId}`
      Supports selecting arbitrary sub-fields of objects by wrapping sub-fields inside parentheses `( )`:
        * a comma-separated list of sub-fields (a sub-field is a JSON pointer (RFC-6901) separated with `/`) to select
        * sub-selectors can be used to request only specific sub-fields by placing expressions in parentheses `( )` after a selected subfield
          For example:
           * `?fields={featureId}/properties(color,brightness)` would select only `color` and `brightness` property values (if present) of the feature identified with `{featureId}`
           * `?fields={featureId}/properties(location/longitude)` would select the `longitude` value inside the `location` object of the feature identified with `{featureId}`


  #### Examples
  * `?fields=EnvironmentScanner/properties(temperature,humidity)`
  * `?fields=EnvironmentScanner/properties(temperature,humidity),Vehicle/properties/configuration`
