name: timeout
in: query
description: |-
  Defines how long the backend should wait for completion of the request, e.g. applied when waiting for requested
  acknowledgements via the `requested-acks` param. Can be specified without unit (then seconds are assumed) or
  together with `s`, `ms` or `m` unit. Example: `42s`, `1m`.

  The default (if omitted) and maximum timeout is `60s`. A value of `0` applies fire and forget semantics for
  the command resulting in setting `response-required=false`.
