  Contains a comma-separated list of fields from the selected feature to be
  included in the returned JSON.

  #### Selectable fields

  * `properties`

    Supports selecting arbitrary sub-fields by using a comma-separated list:
      * several properties paths can be passed as a comma-separated list of JSON pointers (RFC-6901)

        For example:
          * `?fields=properties/color` would select only `color` property value (if present)
          * `?fields=properties/color,properties/brightness` would select only `color` and `brightness` property values (if present)

    Supports selecting arbitrary sub-fields of objects by wrapping sub-fields inside parentheses `( )`:
      * a comma-separated list of sub-fields (a sub-field is a JSON pointer (RFC-6901) separated with `/`) to select
      * sub-selectors can be used to request only specific sub-fields by placing expressions in parentheses `( )` after a selected subfield

        For example:
         * `?fields=properties(color,brightness)` would select only `color` and `brightness` property values (if present)
         * `?fields=properties(location/longitude)` would select the `longitude` value inside the `location` object

  #### Examples

  * `?fields=properties(color,brightness)`
