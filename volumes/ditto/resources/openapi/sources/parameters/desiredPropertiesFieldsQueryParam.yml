  Contains a comma-separated list of fields from the desiredProperties to be
  included in the returned JSON.

  #### Selectable fields

  Supports selecting arbitrary sub-fields as defined in the desiredProperties by
  using a comma-separated list:
    * several desiredProperties paths can be passed as a comma-separated list of JSON pointers (RFC-6901)

      For example:
        * `?fields=temperature` would select only `temperature` property value of desiredProperties (if present)
        * `?fields=temperature,humidity` would select only `temperature` and `humidity` property values of desiredProperties (if present)

  Supports selecting arbitrary sub-fields of objects by wrapping sub-fields
  inside parentheses `( )`:
    * a comma-separated list of sub-fields (a sub-field is a JSON pointer (RFC-6901) separated with `/`) to select
    * sub-selectors can be used to request only specific sub-fields by placing expressions in parentheses `( )` after a selected subfield

      For example:
       * `?fields=location(longitude,latitude)` would select the `longitude` and `latitude` value inside the `location` property of desiredProperties

  #### Examples

  * `?fields=temperature,humidity,location(longitude,latitude)`

  * `?fields=configuration,status(powerConsumption/watts)`
